        """
        Class for handling data augmentation for NCA training. 
        data_init is called before training,
        data_callback is called during training
        
        Also handles JAX array sharding, so all methods of NCA_trainer work
        on multi-gpu setups. Currently splits data onto different GPUs by batches


        Modified version of DataAugmenter where each batch can have different spatial resolution/size
        Treat data as Pytree of trajectories, where each leaf is a different batch f32[N,CHANNEL,WIDTH,HEIGHT]
        Parameters
        ----------
        data_true : PyTree [BATCHES] f32[N,CHANNELS,WIDTH,HEIGHT]
            true un-augmented data
        hidden_channels : int optional
            number of hidden channels to zero-pad to data. Defaults to zero
